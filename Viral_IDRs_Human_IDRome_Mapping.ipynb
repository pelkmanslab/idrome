      "Since IDRs are more prevalent in important signaling networks and they are more promiscuous than well-structured regions it is likely that they are often hijacked or mimicked by viral proteins. Also, viruses/viral families will likely make use of different approaches to hijack only the pathways that are important to their specific reproductive sequence.\n",
